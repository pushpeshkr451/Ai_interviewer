### üî¥ [Try the Live Demo Here!](https://personal-ai-interviewer.onrender.com/) üî¥

An interactive, voice-powered interview simulator that leverages Google's Gemini API to conduct realistic job interviews based on a user's resume.

## Description

This web application provides a platform for users to practice their interview skills in a simulated environment. A user uploads their resume, specifies the job role they are applying for, and the AI, powered by the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, initiates and conducts a voice-based interview. The AI's questions are tailored to the candidate's resume and the specified job role, providing a highly relevant and personalized experience. The application uses the Web Speech API for voice recognition and text-to-speech, allowing for a hands-free, conversational interview flow.
